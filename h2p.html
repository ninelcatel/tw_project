        <h1>Rules of Backgammon</h1>
        <h2>General rules</h2>
        <p> Backgammon is a game made for two players, 1 versus 1 each player having 15 total pieces and their goal is to be the first one to get all their pieces out of the board</p>
        <p>
            The board consists of 24 columns often adressed as "triangles" split into 4 quadrants,top right is Black's "home" and bottom right is White's "home", we will see later what this "home" means.The starting position for the 30 pieces is visualized in the following image:
        </p>
        <p>
            White is always first, and players generally roll the dice before the game to see who is white and who is black.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every turn, the respective player has to roll the dice and use it to move the pieces on the board,in a clockwise manner for Black,  and counter-clockwise manner for White.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number on the die represents how many triangles can you move the piece you will choose, for example a (3,6) dice pair will allow the player to move a piece 3 triangles and then 6 triangles,or the other way around.A player can choose in the limits of the game's rules the piece, and is allowed use both dice for a single piece.
        </p>
        <h2>
            One piece rule
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you have a SINGLE piece on a collumn, your opponent can "take" your piece if his piece moves on the specific collumn your "alone" piece is placed and put it on the bar (the middle of the board).
        </p>
        <p>
            While you have one or even more pieces on the bar, you CAN NOT move normally, you MUST first get your piece back in the game.To do that you roll the dice as you do every turn, and select which collumn from your OPPONENT'S home you want to move the piece on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Important! the collumns are numbered from right to left.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Two piece rule
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you have two or more pieces on a collumn your opponent cannot move on the specific collumn, meaning that if he hits a die that moves a specific piece on your two piece collumn, he will not be able to move using that combination of die and piece, he will need to use a different combination or WORST case scenario, he has no valid moves and his turn is skipped.
        </p>
        <h2>Winning</h2>
        <p>Winning in this game consists of getting all of your pieces out of the board, to do so you must first have all your pieces in your home, for example, if white wants to remove a piece he must first have all his pieces in the bottom right corner (White's home).
        </p>
        <p>If you have all your pieces in the "home" area, you are ready to start removing your pieces, to do so , you roll the dice as you normally do every turn and select the collumn (corresponding to the die number) from which you want to remove OR move the piece,even though your main goal is winning, you can still make normal moves, so that the pieces to advance further on the board. </p>
        <p>As a player you are obligated to remove a piece if the die's number is as high or higher than the columns on which you have pieces.For example if you roll a (6,1) and you have a piece on the 5th collumn and 2nd one , you can't use the 6 die to remove the piece on the 2nd collumn  and the 1 die to move the piece on the 5th collumn, you MUST use the 6 die to remove the piece from the 5th collumn and then move accordingly</p>
