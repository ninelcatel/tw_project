        <h1>Welcome to  Ninelgammon!</h1>
            <h3>
                What exactly is <strong>"Ninelgammon"</strong>?
            </h3> 
            <p>
                Well,to put it simply, its a site made by Ninel, on which you learn how to play backgammon , about the projects that the creator made involving Backgammon, and the actual game!
            </p>
            <h3>
                There already are some online Backgammon sites, why play here?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You don't have to! Even though i love the game i cannot negate the fact that it's the infamous "old people" game, mainly seeing this game be played by your grandpa , your elderly teachers , etc. That being said, i feel like this is the main reason that most of the websites that revolve around backgammon are really outdated, maybe not even have a secure connection,so i thought this project would be great for reviving the Backgammon fanbase and make the interface a bit more modern.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Is "Ninelgammon" different than regular Backgammon?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Not really,the only thing changed about the game other than the obvious name  is that the doubling rule is not valid here, check the <a href="h2play.html">"How to play"</a> section on the left.
